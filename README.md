<h4>HHub Project</h4>

<h3>Prologue</h3>

Inspired by an idea about a large-scale social networking platform that support vast user base to communicate. Also, it's a chance for me to cultivate my mindset needed to architect and manage high-traffic applications that serve a large number of users. It's why this project was conceived, to help me explore more about scalable architectures, performance optimization, and deployment workflows for real-world social networking systems.
